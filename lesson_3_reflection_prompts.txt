forks is when i donâ€™t have control on repository. Clone is to get access locally. Branches is to keep seperate changes I am making to code as I work on it

Allows you to see if there are confilicts. If there are none, you can just fast-forward merge

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
We would then need to email each other files or use a drop box or other shared folder. Git hub makes it easier and formal

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Easier to do master when you are just doing small changes. For experimenting, better to have different branch or working on bigger features
