When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share or collaborate with others. Its also a good way to back up 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Someone else made changes so I want control on latest updates to branch.. Perhaps I will merge later?
